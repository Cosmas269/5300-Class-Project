    "Now, to get to this lagrangian their were a couple of core assumptions I made.  No interstella drag force, no gravitational effects of relativity.  I also didn't take into account the Roche radius and instead just opted to treat each mass as a point particle and have them bounce off of each other when making contact.  I would like to implement said roche radius but I'm sure that would balloon the computational power required and the amount of time this would take.  Also just sticking to a 2d plane, 3d wouldn't be that much harder to implement but I know what the 2d results of some systems look like so I decided to use that limitation. So I just stuck bodies with masses and the gravitational force on them.  With all that assumed I solved the lagrangian to find.  \n",

Now, due to the time it takes to generate each simulation, and its animation, as well as the amount of time taken to trouble shoot, I can't be certain that everything works without issue.  For example, I know that when it is told to do the random simulation it has failed to produce things on a number of occasions, but I think it's working now.  Aso, due to the interactive nature of this, it's not really set up to just run it all and talk about the results.\n",

    "## Lets talk about some of the import choices. \n",
    "  I chose to create and import several classes.  The Nbodysimulatorclass handles all the integration and ploting.  I also stored my user input function in there as well.  Probably could have made that a seperate class, or kept it in this notebook, but it seemed like a good idea at the time and I'm afraid I'll break something if I change it.  The plotting is alos included in that class.  I really should have included it in the animation class, but I originally tried to get manon to work so it made sense to keep them seperate.  It's not going to get changed because it works, and I don't want to break anything.  Probably could have combined the two classes, but the longer a document gets the harder I find it to manage so seperating them so I could have them open in different windows worked better for me.  Also I had an issue with running into memory limits, so I increased the amount of memory an animation was allowed to use.  I have still seen simulation choice 2 get up to 150ish megs so it's best to keep that in.  "

I have set this simulation to accept inputs in days, as I find that more intuitive with the scale I was simulating, but I left G in seconds.  So I needed a place to convert days to seconds, and this also seemed like a good place to set the time scale for integration.  \n",
    "I was having problems with it taking forever to simulate, it was to the point where I was trying to impliment multi-core calculations, and was thinking about cuda implimentation.  I chose against it, partially because it was eating into my time, and partially because I didn't know what the end user would be using so it felt like it was taking more time than it would save.  \n",
    "The simulations where to long though, then I realized I was using np.linspace instead of np.arange.  As we can see in the example below running a simulation that is 100,000 days, has 10,000 points for np.arange, but 864000 for np linespace.  Currently it should be set up to cap out at 10000 points no matter how many days the simulation is, but I'm fairly certain the higher the day number the less precise the simulatino will become due to this.  Though before that change I managed to have this thing eat through my 32gb of ram and saturate my m.2 so its a good change.  "
