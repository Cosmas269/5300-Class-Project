# 5300-Class-Project
My N-Body class project for Phy 5300
I think thats good.  Some notes.  Of the premade simulations I've only had the random one fail, the rest will eventually give me the graphs and animations.
In the time function it may be wise to make to change 864 to 8640 instead.  This should drastically speed up the program, and also reduce the file size. 
I believe the largest file size I noticed it get to was about 150mb.  Which I mention in the notebook.  

I have no idea if the final project .py file works.  I don't feel comfortable engough running things through command prompts to test it in the time I have left since I have places to be.  Still, thought it would be a nice include, if it works.  

In the notebook, it gives some empty graphs, I'm pretty sure that's part of a work around I had to use to get things to animate.  
Also, I used the 5300 runtime enviroment for these just to ensure compatability.  I don't think I used anything not a part of that at least.  

The animation file contains various animations I've saved from the simulator.  That said it is contains the failures of I had along the way.

Well, this is all done.  I enjoyed the class, despite the early time.  Like I mentioned in the evaluation I'll mention it here as well, consider using sciserver.org instead of class.osc.  It doesn't time you out and force you to restart your enviroment, but, I'm unsure if it has a good way to get the all the notebooks to the students.  Perhaps Proffesor Terndrup from the astrophysics department would know.  Well that's my last two cents.  I hope the notebook works, and have a pleasent day.
